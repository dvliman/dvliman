Hi there üëã, I am David Liman. 

I am a software engineer with over a decade of experience building backend services. I have worked in different industries, from advertising, medical, fintech, and fitness space. 

My ideal role would involve designing, building, documenting, and maintaining software systems.  I am happiest when I can alternate high-level and low-level work, and I am never afraid to dig deep into any technology.

I believe people do their best thinking when they come together to solve problems, when they are supported, respected, and growing. I find bottom-up leadership more appealing.

## Location
I am based in Los Angeles, California but prefer to work as part of a mostly or fully distributed teams.
